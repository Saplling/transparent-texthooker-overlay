# Overview
This is a transparent overlay that listens for websocket output and display it on a page that can be read by yomitan. The goal is to have a window that can be placed on top of whatever text is being read and use yomitan on it directly rather than going back and forth between a texthooker page.

# Instructions
- Download the zip file in releases
- Unzip
- Run transparent-textbox.exe
- Click on the yomitan icon to open the yomitan settings page
- Import your settings and dictionaries
- Click the gear icon and set your websocket URL
- Enjoy
